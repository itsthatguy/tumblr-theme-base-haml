## Tumblr Theme Base (Haml Version)

To help with Tumblr theme development for those allergic to straight HTML, here's a Haml version of the [Tumblr theme base](http://www.tumblr.com/docs/en/custom_themes). It renders to nice, clean HTML.

### Additions to the original Tumblr base:

* A stylesheet link. After you [upload your CSS file](http://www.tumblr.com/themes/upload_static_file), place the generated file location here.

### Forthcoming additions:

* Search form
* Pagination block
